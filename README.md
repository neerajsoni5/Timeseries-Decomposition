# Timeseries-Decomposition
Understand about the different components of Time Series

Basically a Time series is combination of 4 components :
    a)Level-  The average value in the series.
    b) Trend-  The increasing or decreasing value in the series.
     c)Seasonality- The repeating short-term cycle in the series.
     e)noise-  The random variation in the series.

Level and Noise â€“ are some time combined and labellled as Remainder.

Decomposition helps  for better understanding problems during time series analysis and forecasting.
